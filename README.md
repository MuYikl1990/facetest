# facetest
A demo to test faces and count the number
## *Use the opencv's haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml to test the faces of some people, and count the number of people.*
## *If the face is not complete or vague, the accuracy of test number maybe not good ( approximately 70 percent -_-: ).*
## Here are some tips when you run this project:
### 1. Within Shell run project via `python manage.py runserver` in Root Directory, and show upload page on http://127.0.0.1:8000.
### 2. Second, upload a picture and run test via `python test.py` in Root Directory ,then a message will flash to show the number of faces.
### 3. Finally, click the button named 'show' on http://127.0.0.1:8000, a new picture will pop to show the result of faces'detection.
### 4. The project has Linux version and use nginx to realize proxy.
